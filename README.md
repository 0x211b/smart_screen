# smart_screen
Magic Mirror like program but designed in Python as opposed to JavaScript only.

main python program reads JSON config file to include modules to load and location on screen, much like Magic Mirror.

module ideas:
  clock,
  calendar,
  weather,
  MOTD,
  news,
  picture rotater,
  wallpaper

Need error checking of main program and each module.

Would like to have hyperlinks in modules to expand info (with a timeout feature to drop back to main)
